    </h3>

    <p>During 1996–2006, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Finland (MAFF), MTT Agrifood Research and the Finnish Geodetic Institute performed a joint remote sensing satellite research project. It evaluated the applicability of optical satellite (Landsat, SPOT) data for cereal yield estimations in the annual crop inventory program. Four Optical Vegetation Indices models (I: Infrared polynomial, II: NDVI, III: GEMI, IV: PARND/FAPAR) were validated to estimate cereal baseline yield levels (yb) using solely optical harmonized satellite data (Optical Minimum Dataset). </p>

    <p>The optimized Model II (NDVI) yb level was 4,240 kg/ha (R2 0.73, RMSE 297 kg/ha) for wheat and 4390 kg/ha (R2 0.61, RMSE 449 kg/ha) for barley and Model I yb was 3,480 kg/ha for oats (R2 0.76, RMSE 258 kg/ha). Optical VGI yield estimates were validated with CropWatN crop model yield estimates using SPOT and NOAA data (mean R2 0.71, RMSE 436 kg/ha) and with composite SAR/ASAR and NDVI models (mean R2 0.61, RMSE 402 kg/ha) using both reflectance and backscattering data. CropWatN and Composite SAR/ASAR &amp; NDVI model mean yields were 4,754/4,170 kg/ha for wheat, 4,192/3,848 kg/ha for barley and 4,992/2,935 kg/ha for oats.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>A transformation defined on the near-infrared (NIR) and middle-infrared (MIR) space is presented that allows deriving a new coordinate system appropriate for vegetation and burned area discrimination. The transformation is based on the difference between MIR and NIR in conjunction with the distance from a convergence point in the MIR/NIR space, representative of a totally burnt surface. </p>

    <p>One of the derived coordinates presents a small scatter for pixels associated to vegetated surfaces (strict scale) whereas the other one covers a wide range of values (large scale) that suggest its use as a proxy of water content of vegetation. The strict scale character of the first coordinate together with the large scale character of the second one make the coordinate system especially adequate to discriminate vegetated surfaces and rank them according to the water content, from green and dry to burned vegetation. </p>

    <p>The performance of the new coordinate system is then assessed against than traditional ratio or modified ratio indices (namely the Vegetation Index, the Burned Area Index and the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, modified to the MIR/NIR space) and it is shown that the new coordinate system provides better information than traditional indices, opening interesting perspectives for burned area discrimination and other applications like drought monitoring.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>Wildland fires are an annually recurring phenomenon in many terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate burned area estimates are important for modeling fire-induced trace gas emissions and rehabilitating post-fire landscapes. High spatial and spectral resolution MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over three 2007 southern California burns were used to evaluate the sensitivity of different spectral indices at discriminating burned land shortly after a fire.</p>

    <p>The performance of the indices, which included both traditional and new band combinations, was assessed by means of a separability index that provides an assessment of the effectiveness of a given index at discriminating between burned and unburned land. In the context of burned land applications results demonstrated</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(i) that the highest sensitivity of the longer short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region (1.9 to 2.5 μm) was found at the band interval from 2.31 to 2.36 μm, </li>
        <li>(ii) the high discriminatory power of the mid infrared spectral domain (3 to 5.5 μm) and </li>
        <li>(iii) the high potential of emissivity data. As a consequence, a newly proposed index which combined near infrared (NIR), longer SWIR and emissivity outperformed all other indices when results were averaged over the three fires. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Results were slightly different between land cover types (shrubland vs. forest-woodland). Prior to use in the indices the thermal infrared data were separated into temperature and emissivity to assess the benefits of using both temperature and emissivity. Currently, the only spaceborne sensor that provides moderate spatial resolution (&lt; 100 m) temperature and emissivity data is the Advanced Spaceborne and Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER). </p>

    <p>Therefore, our findings can open new perspectives for the utility of future sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared (HyspIRI) sensor. However, further research is required to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed band combinations in other vegetation types and different fire regimes.</p>
